# rock-paper-scissors
a hard stone, a piece of a tree, and a cutting implement will go head to head in the battle of the century

things I learned: functions mostly. how to use them to make series of events happen. organizing my code and working around the pitfalls of scope WRT variables and such. had a bit of difficulty making it count points for a mo, as well as another problem i'd had earlier just making it differentiate between player inputs from the prompt; I believe I had messed up how it interpreted the text due to a syntax error, so it would interpret any string as correct for a while.

future improvements to work on: making my code cleaner and more efficient - I am well aware this could be accomplished in a much shorter format with less repetition. I tried to do it without using loops, for one thing. For another, it's simply the way I typed up the rock paper scissors if/else stuff - that could be much more organized/clean as well.
